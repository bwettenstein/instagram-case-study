          <p>
            I collaborated with a team of five in my course to observe and
            interview users of a product of our choice to identify the root
            causes of problems, analyze your data, and propose a redesign. All
            of this was done with a 1 week deadline. After talking about apps
            that we used that overwent UI hauls that confused us, we chose
            Instagram because it had recently pushed out a massive update that
            rearranged icons and added new functionality pages.

          <p>
            By emphasizing the reels and shop tabs on the new Instagram update
            and minimizing tabs which are conducive to positive user social
            interactions, designers have hindered the user’s mental model.

          <p>
            My team and I were interested in seeing if there was a way to
            incorporate the new Instagram changes in a way that was not only
            clearer for old users who had been used to the previous design, but
            also new users who are discovering the new features.

          <p class="">
            The survey was used to gather demographic information about our
            participants, as well as how familiar they are with the app. My
            teammates came up with the questions and I transferred them to a
            Google form. The survey itself wasn't that long because we just
            wanted simple demographic information and we didn't want people to
            feel burdened to take a 10+ question survey. The link was shared
            with different UCSD students and staff members through mass emailing
            different groups. It was also shared with different city-related
            Facebook groups. Overall, this allowed us to get a plethora of
            different demographics and experience data.

            Each member of our team conducted 3 one-on-one interviews with
            survey participants who opted-in, totalling 18 interviews. We
            prepared a list of tasks that we felt would test the user's
            knowledge of the app and how the app presents itself. We also
            included tasks that focused on the new additions to the app: the
            Reels and Shop pages. Adhering to the master-apprentice model, we
            left the interviewees to share their thoughts freely without any
            guidance that is too specific. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these
            were conducted through Zoom.

            One key trend we noticed through our observations were that the vast
            majority of users didn't use the shop tab at all. In order to
            understand why, we asked what the user's main use for Instagram was.
            From our findings listed below, we determined that the shop tab
            isn't viewed as important because it doesn't follow what users use
            Instagram for.

            One key trend we noticed through our observations were that there
            were a lot of features in the app that were unknown to the user.
            From our post observation interviews, we determined that this was
            because Instagram had so many features that ended up being hidden
            away, or unnoticed. The last major trend that we noticed was that
            users generally had difficulty in dealing with reels.

            Another major trend we was that a lot of users ran into difficulty
            when it came to uploading a post, reel, going live, or posting a
            story. One user mentioned that they always made mistakes whenever
            they wanted to post something because of how many different ways
            there were. Swiping right from the feed presents a designated area
            to upload a post, reel, live story, or story. However making a post,
            story and reel have their own dedicated buttons on the app.

            The last major trend that we noticed was that users generally had
            difficulty in dealing with reels. In our post observation
            interviews, <strong>13/18</strong> said that dealing with reels was
            the most difficult task in the whole interview.

                <strong>11/18</strong> users didn't know where to find, or how to look, for new story filters when adding a story. That is because the “browse
                effects” page is very undiscoverable and does not have clear signifiers. In order to browse
                effects, users have to scroll all the way to the far right in the camera page. Alternatively, they
                could go to an existing effect, click on the effect’s name, and click on “Browse Effects”. Both
                methods are not intuitive. <br>
                <strong>6/18</strong> users weren't aware that they could create folders to save posts to.
