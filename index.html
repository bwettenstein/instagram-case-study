          <p>
            I collaborated with a team of five in my course to observe and
            interview users of a product of our choice to identify the root
            causes of problems, analyze your data, and propose a redesign. This
            project allowed me to grow my communication skills through working
            with a group and interviewing users, expanding my design skills
            through creating Figma prototypes, and expanded my HCI skillset. All
            of this was done with a 1 week deadline.

            My group and I crafted a mind map where we put our heads together
            and tried to come up with different applications we could a redesign
            of. Ultimately, we chose Instagram because it had recently pushed
            out a massive update that rearranged icons and added new
            functionality pages.

            As a group, our goal was to discover pain points and redesign to
            nullify them as best as possible. I created a questionnaire that we
            sent out in order to get demographic info, conducted 3 interviews
            with users, and contributed to prototypes made in
            <strong>Figma.</strong> I also participated in the ideation process
            where we decided which prototype to proceed with and why.

          <p>
            By emphasizing the reels and shop tabs on the new Instagram update
            and minimizing tabs which are conducive to positive user social
            interactions, designers have hindered the user’s mental model.

            My team and I were interested in seeing if there was a way to
            incorporate the new Instagram changes in a way that was not only
            clearer for old users who had been used to the previous design, but
            also new users who are discovering the new features.

            The survey was used to gather demographic information about our
            participants, as well as how familiar they are with the app. My
            teammates came up with the questions and I transferred them to a
            Google form. The survey itself wasn't that long because we just
            wanted simple demographic information and we didn't want people to
            feel burdened to take a 10+ question survey. The link was shared
            with different UCSD students and staff members through mass emailing
            different groups.

            Each member of our team conducted 3 one-on-one interviews with each

            felt would test the user's knowledge of the app and how the app
            presents itself. We also included tasks that focused on the new
            additions to the app: the Reels and Shop pages. Adhering to the
            master-apprentice model, we left the interviewees to share their
            thoughts freely without any guidance that is too specific.

          <h1 class="title is-4">Key Trends</h1>
          <p>
            One key trend we noticed through our observations were that the vast
            majority of users didn't use the shop tab at all. In order to
            understand why, we asked what the user's main use for Instagram was.
            From our findings listed below, we determined that the shop tab
            isn't viewed as important because it doesn't follow what users use
            Instagram for.
          </p>

            <strong>Figure 5:</strong> of the usage data we collected from

      <div class="columns is-centered">
        <div class="column is-half">
          <p>
            Another trend we noticed through our observations were that there
            were a lot of features in the app that were unknown to the user.
            From our post observation interviews, we determined that this was
            not only because Instagram had so many features that ended up being
            hidden away, but also they lack clear signifiers for where to find
            the features. For example,
            <strong
              >1/3 of users couldn't figure out how to find all the posts
              they've liked because it's hidden deep in their account
              settings.</strong
            >
            Again, our post observation interviews told us that users didn't
            expect viewing liked posts to be in a settings page, especially
            since there is already a "like" on the top left of the page.
          </p>
          <br />
          <figure class="image is-2by2">
            <img src="./img/user-like-pov.png" alt="user-like-pov" />
          </figure>
          <p>
            <strong>Figure 6:</strong> Steps that a user had to take in order to
            find the "posts you've liked" page (
            <a href="./img/user-like-pov.png">Click here for full size</a>
            )
          </p>
          <br />
          <figure class="image is-2by2">

        <div class="column is-half">
          <p>
            Additionally, another trend we discovered was that a lot of users
            ran into difficulty when it came to uploading a post, reel, going
            live, or posting a story. One user mentioned that they always made
            mistakes whenever they wanted to post something because of how many
            different ways there were. Swiping right from the feed presents a
            designated area to upload a post, reel, live story, or story.
            However making a post, story and reel have their own dedicated
            buttons on the app.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="columns is-centered">
        <div class="column is-half">
          <p>
            The last major trend that we noticed was that users generally had
            difficulty in dealing with reels. In our post observation
            interviews, <strong>13/18</strong> said that dealing with reels was
            <strong>the most difficult task</strong> in the whole interview.
            From these interviews, we concluded that
            <strong
              >the problem was that the process of saving Reels was completely
              different than saving posts.</strong
            >
            In order to save a post the user has to click on the bookmark icon
            to save it. However the method to achieve the same things under both
            tabs was inconsistent; there was no bookmark icon to save a reel,
            therefore the users were confused and had a lot of difficulty being
            able to save a reel.

            Because of our short time limit, we weren't able to perform in-depth
            user interviews to further improve our prototypes; instead; we
            looked at our core design challenges and used those as a foundation.

          <p>
            To keep the focus on viewing and posting images, we knew that we
            wanted a way to seperate the Reels and Shop feeds from the app.
            Ultimately, we decided to have a hamburger menu at the header that
            would change change feeds because we felt that hamburger menus were
            so well known that it wouldn't take too long for users to adapt to,
            or recognize, it.

          <p>
            After immense discussion within the group with the tradebacks of
            each component, I decided that we should go with option C because we
            felt that it was the most intuitive. Yes, the camera icon that was
            originally in the top right is replaced; however, the ability to
            swipe to the right and open the camera remains the same. For years,
            this has been a way to access the camera in the app, and I felt that
            because the camera was only one screen away, replacing its icon to
            add functionality was a good trade off.

            With the hamburger menu we went back and forth when it came to the
            Posts icon. With A, we thought about reusing the "add post" icon
            because it was an icon that was part of the app for years and
            signified actual posts. Ultimately, we went with option B because we
            felt that the home icon was a more accurate fit. Our interviews
            showed that people prioritized viewing the image feed over
            Instagram's other offerings. To us, the home icon would signify the
            user saying "take me home," in this case back to the home page. With
            this menu, all types of posts are equally easily discoverable.

          <h1 class="title is-5">Component 3: Bottom Navigation</h1>

          <p>
            With the bottom navigation, I felt that it should hold icons for
            tools that relate to the actual image feed because when users load
            the app, they'll immediately be at the image feed. This way, they
            can quickly access aspects such as their feed and their activity,
            without having to go to the top corner of the app. From there, I
            created 5 prototypes and filled them with different icons and
            orientations of icons that corresponded to a feed task.

          <ol type="A">
            <li>
              We added a save posts icon because enough users didn't realize
              that there was a way to view all their saved posts
            </li>
            <li>
              We placed the heart icon back to where it was for years before the
              updated design because most users were confused with the new
              placement and preferred the old one. We also swapped the search
              icon with the message icon
            </li>
            <li>The same as B, except the search icon is still present</li>
            <li>
              Replaces the search icon with the camera icon and adds the saved
              page icon
            </li>
            <li>Very minimalistic, with only 4 total icons</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>
            I ultimately decided that we should go with C because it places the
            icons closer to where they were for years, which should mitigate the
            navigation errors that users encountered.

          <br />
          <p>
            Because navigating through Reels was the most common pain point
            amongst users, we knew that we would have to reorganize how the
            icons are presented. Specifically, icons that are visible on
            traditional image posts should be visible on Reels too in order to
            create a consistency. Ultimately, I decided that we should proceed
            with <strong>A</strong> because comment and like counters are
            visible on normal image posts. Keeping them would maintain a
            consistency and reduce pain points related to differences between
            Reels and images.

          <br />
          <p>
            I knew that we had to find a way to make the "liked posts" feature
            more salient because 1/3 of our users weren't able to find it. To
            me, the best way to do this would be to make it accessible when
            users hit the heart icon on the top right because each of the users
            that made up the 1/3 that couldn't find it, incorrectly went to the
            heart icon. To them, it made sense that anything relating to "likes"
            was in the page with the icon that matches the like icon. Hence, I
            suggested that we make the "liked posts" page accessible through the
            heart icon we moved to our redesigned footer because it's a more
            intuitive location than settings and would fix the issues that our
            users had with it.

            Overall, I think that we crafted something that targeted the main
            pain points that we uncovered through our user research. Had we had
            more time, this prototype could've been improved by further user
            research to drive ideation. Sadly, we didn't have enough time to, so
            we had to use our best judgment when it came to finalizing the
            prototype.

            This was by far the most intense and largest scale of any project I
            have taken on. It was immensely challenging, but ultimately it was
            highly rewarding. I got to collaborate with a group of passionate
            designers, conduct full interviews with users to uncover pain
            points, and redesign according to them. Here are a few of my major
            takeaways from this project:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Letting go of preconceived ideas and biases are important;
              otherwise, it'll be impossible to determine what needs a redesign.
              Case in point, what I thought would end up becoming pain points to
              the users, were actually never mentioned in any interview.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be patient with users. Sometimes if they're slower than you'd like
              to grasp aspects of the application or with replying, they could
              either be nervous or genuinely confused with what they have to do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to make your redesign consistent with the current app's style,
              otherwise it could appear jarring.
            </li>

            <li>
              When part of a team, make sure the criticism is actually
              constructive. It's not worth it to hurt someone's feelings in
              order to make a point.
            </li>
